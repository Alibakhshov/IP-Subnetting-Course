These bits will remain constant and for each host on the network the <b>host ID</b> will be different whereas the <b>network ID</b> will remain the same. Therefore, how many different IP addresses I can get for this network ID entirely depends on how many different combinations I could get of these host bits.\n",

So for example if I said two to the power of five two to the power of five will tell me how many different combinations I could get five bits. So two to the power of the number of host ID bits will give me how many IP addresses I have in this range including the network ID and the directed broadcast IP. Those therefore are not valid IPs so I have to subtract those two.\n",

    "They have special meaning.\n",

    "One is the network ID and the other is the direct to broadcast IP.\n",
