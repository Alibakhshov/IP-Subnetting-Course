    "<p><b>Broadcast</b> Broadcasting is the simultaneous transmission of the same message to multiple recipients. In networking, broadcasting occurs when a transmitted data packet is received by all network devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security issues may arise during broadcasting and lead to data loss if a network is attacked by intruders. In non-networking or electronic broadcasting, the term broadcasting denotes the transfer of audio and video data between nodes and devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Techopedia Explains Broadcasting</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting may occur in either of the following ways:\n",
    "A high-level program operation, such as broadcasting the Message Passing Interface (MPI)\n",
    "A low-level networking operation, such as broadcasting via Ethernet.\n",
    "Broadcasting is basically limited to local area network (LAN) systems. In a LAN, however, its performance impact is more substantial in a wide area network (WAN).\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) uses multicasting, rather than broadcasting, to avoid network interruption when services are required by only one or two nodes. During data transmission, IPv6 transmits data directly to devices and does not disturb network device traffic.</p>"
