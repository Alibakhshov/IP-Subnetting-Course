    "Because this is class B it gets a default prefix length of slash 16 which means that the first two octets are network ID. If you looked at it carefully. You actually have a range of network IDs from <b>172.16</b> to <b>172.31</b>. Ther is actually 16 network IDs in that range. I can assign <b>172.16</b> to one network and then I have <b>172.17</b> which I can assign and then I have <b>172.18</b>, <b>172.19</b>, <b>172.20</b> all the way to <b>172.31</b>. So I have 16 network IDs in this range, each network ID has the last two octets for host ID. So I have 16 bits for host ID. Therefore each one of these network IDS will give me 65534 IP addresses.</p>\n",
