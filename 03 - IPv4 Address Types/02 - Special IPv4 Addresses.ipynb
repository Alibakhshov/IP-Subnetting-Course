    "So for example let's take the IP address below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>172.17.0.0</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario <b>172.17</b> are network ID and the next two octets are <b>host ID</b> and this particular number the host ID section is all zeros.\n",
    "This is sometimes referred to as a <b>routing prefix</b>. This number will appear in the routing table of routers and we used to identify the <b>172.17</b> network.</p>\n",

    "Now there is another type of broadcast IP address called the <b>directed broadcast IP.</b> <b>Directed broadcast IP</b> is the IP address where the host ID is all ones.\n",

    "Let's say we had an IP address of:\n",

    "<b>172.17.255.255/16</b>\n",

    "In this IP address the first 16 bits or the first two octets are the <b>Network ID</b> and the last two octets are <b>host ID.</b> The first two octets has <b>255.255</b> which are all ones. Once the entire host ID section is all once this number you're looking at is therefore directed broadcast IP address and you cannot assign this to a system.\n",

    "\n",
    "So this is the typical IP that most people use.\n",

    "But if I had used 1:27 at 59 dot 63 dot 28 that is also a loopback IP.\n",
