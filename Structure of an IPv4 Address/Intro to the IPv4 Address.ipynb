    "<p>IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers that are typically displayed in dotted decimal notation. A 32-bit address contains two primary parts: the network prefix and the host number. All hosts within a single network share the same network address. Each host also has an address that uniquely identifies it. For the most part, an IP address tells you the city, ZIP code, or area code of your ISP, as well as your ISP's name. IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 192.0. 2.1 in IPv4, and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in CIDR notation by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., 192.0.</p>\n",
