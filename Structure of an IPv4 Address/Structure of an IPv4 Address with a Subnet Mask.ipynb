    "Now this  IP address is actually divided into two parts. It's divided into <b>Network ID</b> and <b>Host ID</b>. Now which number is which? Well, we need a second number to do this. We need a subnet mask.\n",
    "Let's say we had a subnet mask of <b>255.255.255.0</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The what is this doing.\n",

    "Well two five five is eight ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have 8 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.\n",

    "One two three 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 9 2 168 1.5 in binary 192 in binary is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3\n",
