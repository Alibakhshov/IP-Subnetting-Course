Accordimgly, 70 in the fourth octet left uncovered. We have to look at 70 binary so whenever you're confronted with a scenario like this the first process to make your life easy is to look at which octets are covered entirely and that would be the first three octets and then in the octet that is being partially covered take the IP address number in there which is 70 in this case.\n",
