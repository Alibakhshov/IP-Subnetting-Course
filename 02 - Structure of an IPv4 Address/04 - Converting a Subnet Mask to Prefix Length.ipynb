    "In other words if you were to convert this subnet mask into binary how many ones do you have at the beginning of this subnet mask. Well in this octet of the subnet mask we would have eight ones and for the remainder of the subnet mask we would just have zeros. So this subnet mask would therefore cover the first 8 bits of the IP address where network ID that would be your next mask as a prefix.\n",
