    "<p>In this example we have <b>172.20.00000000.00000000/16</b>. Its class B so therefore the default prefix is /16. The first two octets are network ID the last two octets are host ID. I'd like to subnet this so that we get 6000 IP addresses per subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b>Subsetting is where you take bits from host ID and you're making it part of network ID. The bits that you took are called <b>subnet bits.</b> They determine the number of subnets you get and the bits that are left over. Bits that left over for a host ID, those determines the number of IP addresses you get per subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here we want to subnet this to get 6000 IP addresses per subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I'll tackle this problem is I'll actually start off by asking the following question How many\n",
    "\n",
    "how many bits should I leave for host ID to get 6000 IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I can figure that out then what will happen is I'll leave those bits for a host ID and the bits in\n",
    "\n",
    "front of it are the ones I'll take for network ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those bits will become the subnet bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recall the formula 2 to the power of H minus 2 where each is the number of host ID bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will determine how many IP addresses I get with a host bitts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the formula I'm trying to solve here if I were to turn this into an algebra equation is two to the\n",
    "\n",
    "power of H minus two as to be greater than or equal to six thousand What is h.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're trying to solve h I'll solve h by simply working out different combinations of h.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start off by trying H is 10 2 to the power of ten minus two is 1000 and 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need 6000 IPs so that's not enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know if we add one bit to host ID that's going to double the number of IP addresses we get.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if I were to take 11 bits that would give me about 2000 IPs if I were to take 12 bits that would\n",
    "\n",
    "give me 4000 and if I were to take 13 bits that would give me 8000.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's try those.\n",
    "\n",
    "H is 12 2 to the 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minus 2 is 4000 and 94 ages 13 is 2 to the power of 13 minus 2 which is equal to eight thousand one\n",
    "\n",
    "hundred and ninety when H is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of IPs we get is 1000 when it's 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's twice as many when it's 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's 4000 when it's 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's 8000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we need to leave 13 bits for host ID\n",
    "\n",
    "so h here is 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to leave the last 13 bits for host ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is 8 9 10 11 12 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are 13 tidy bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "So therefore what we can take for network ID are these three bits in front of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the sub Nesbitt's.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you take these bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well you take it with a new prefix the original prefix was slash 16 slash 16 17 18 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a new prefix of slash 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "With slash 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three bits become the subnet bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last 13 bits remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Host ID bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will therefore get two to the power of three subnets two to the power of three is eight subnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "And two to the power of thirty two minus 19 which is 13 minus 2 will give us eight thousand one hundred\n",
    "\n",
    "and ninety IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we started off by asking ourselves this question how many bits should I leave for host ID to get\n",
    "\n",
    "6000 IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here we have calculated that we need to leave 13 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "That therefore means we take three bits for network ID and the way we do that is with our new prefix\n",
    "\n",
    "of slash 19 calculating this prefix is the first thing that you do when subsetting a network ID if you\n",
    "\n",
    "calculate this prefix incorrectly then every single thing that we do thereafter will be wrong.</p>"
