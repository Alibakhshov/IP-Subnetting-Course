    "<p>In this example we have <b>172.20.00000000.00000000/16</b>. Its class B so therefore the default prefix is /16. The first two octets are network ID the last two octets are host ID. I'd like to subnet this so that we get 6000 IP addresses per subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b>Subsetting is where you take bits from host ID and you're making it part of network ID. The bits that you took are called <b>subnet bits.</b> They determine the number of subnets you get and the bits that are left over. Bits that left over for a host ID, those determines the number of IP addresses you get per subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here we want to subnet this to get 6000 IP addresses per subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I'll tackle this problem is I'll actually start off by asking the following question. How many bits should I leave for host ID to get 6000 IP addresses? If I can figure that out then what will happen is I'll leave those bits for a host ID and the bits in front of it are the ones I'll take for network ID. Those bits will become the subnet bits. Let's recall the formula 2 to the power of H minus 2 where each is the number of host ID bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/36.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This will determine how many IP addresses I get with a host bits. So the formula I'm trying to solve here if I were to turn this into an algebra equation is: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/37.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "so h here is 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/38.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to leave the last 13 bits for host ID.(as in the picture below)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/39.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So therefore what we can take for network ID are these three bits in front of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a new prefix of slash 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will therefore get two to the power of three subnets. Two to the power of three is eight subnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "And two to the power of thirty two minus 19 which is 13 minus 2 will give us eight thousand one hundred and ninety IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/39.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So we started off by asking ourselves this question how many bits should I leave for host ID to get 6000 IP addresses. And here we have calculated that we need to leave 13 bits. Therefore means we take three bits for network ID and the way we do that is with our new prefix of /19. Calculating this prefix is the first thing that you do when subsetting a network ID. If you calculate this prefix incorrectly then every single thing that we do thereafter will be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our first network ID would be <b>172.20.0.0/19</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The next one would be <b>172.20.32.0/19</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The subnet bits are in the third octet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will increment this by 32\n",
    "\n",
    "32\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyril slash 19 this network ID is where this bit is a 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the remaining two bits in front here are zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the 0 0 1 combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next network ID would be 172 dot 20 dot and we're incrementing the previous one by 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this would be 64\n",
    "\n",
    "zero slash 19 this one is the combination where the subnet bits are 0 1 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we basically continue with this trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll work out the others here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me just scroll down\n",
    "\n",
    "one 72 28 96 dot 0 slash 19 172 dot 20 so 96 plus 32 is 128 dot zero slash 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "172 dot 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "128 plus 32 is 160.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dot 0 slash 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're supposed to get eight.\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently have six.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I have two more 172 dot 20 dot 160 plus 32 is 192 not zero slash 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "And let me just make some more room for myself here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last one is 172 dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twenty 192 Plus thirty two is two to four got zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slash 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me just see if I could center this correctly and there we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are our 8 network IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We took the subnet bits from the third octet therefore we're incrementing the third octet by the value\n",
    "\n",
    "of the subnet bit with the lowest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific example it's this bit and this bit carries the value of 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore in this example we will increment the third octet by 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "You write out the original network ID with the new prefix and this will be our first subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our first subnet because in the third octet the subnet bit Searls 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next network ID will increment this third octet by 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we just keep doing that until we have 8 subnets\n",
    "\n",
    "and there we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are our eight subnets\n",
