    "<p>In this example, we have <b>192.168.40.00000000</b>. It's Class C so the default prefix is /24. And I would like to submit this to get 25 IPs addresses per subnet. The first step in doing this is to work out the new prefix the prefix value would tell us how many bits we should take from host ID and make part of network ID. In other words the new prefix will tell us what our subnet bits are.\n",

In this case that is two to the power of three which is equal to eight. We therefore will get eight subnets each of which giving us two to the power of 30 minus 27 which works out to 30 IPs.\n",
