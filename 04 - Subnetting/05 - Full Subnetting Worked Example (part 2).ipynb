    "<p>In this example, we have <b>192.168.40.00000000</b>. It's Class C so the default prefix is /24. And I would like to submit this to get 25 IPs addresses per subnet. The first step in doing this is to work out the new prefix the prefix value would tell us how many bits we should take from host ID and make part of network ID. In other words the new prefix will tell us what our subnet bits are.\n",
